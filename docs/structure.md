The actual program will be based on participant submission. The draft program below is based on the thematic suggestions from the call for contributions and will be updated after all submissions have been reviewed (in June 2017):

### Introductory activity
Ideally hands-on, involving artifacts and maybe making something. Will be decided depending on group size and types of contribution.  

### Presentation and discussion of contributions
Presentation format will be Pecha Kucha in order to avoid “death by Powerpoint”. There will be clear focus on discussion.   


### Closing panel discussion
Workshop chairs, project members from FAB101  and selected authors from the contributing community.
