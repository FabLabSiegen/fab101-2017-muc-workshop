## Ãœber den Workshop / Maker Space

The Makerspace will replace the workshop **"Academic practices in (community) innovation and (digital) fabrication"** and will take place on Monday during the conference. It will be open and accessible for passers-by and intends to present a mix of showroom, hands-on workshops area, speakers-corner and opportunity for networking. There will be some 3d printers, a lasercutter, tools and other fancy stuff for everyone to experiment, create, learn and share your knowledge.
The purpose of the makerspace is to learn about making, meet other makers and hackers or people interested in making.

There will a short program in which you can participate:

* short workshops about community innovation and academic practices around Fab Labs
* short presentations with Q&A
* hands-on workshops on making. E.g. 3d-printing, upcycling or playful 3d design

There will also be a showroom with artifacts from the Fab Lab Siegen, some demos and projects of students of the University of Siegen.

The motto of makerspace is 'make, hack, learn and share' and is organized by the FabLab Siegen and University of Siegen in cooperation with TU Berlin.
